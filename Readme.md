# Neural Slime Volleyball

HTML5-JS Slime Volleyball clone.  AI agent is a trained recurrent neural network, trained using basic conventional neuroevolution techniques.  Neural network implemented using the [convnetjs](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/) library.  It is very difficult to win!

See my blog post at [blog.otoro.net](http://blog.otoro.net/2015/03/28/neural-slime-volleyball/) for more information, or [otoro.net](http://otoro.net/slimevolley/) to actually play the game.
